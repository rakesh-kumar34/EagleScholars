This project was part of my final semester capstone project for course (Information Systems Design and Development) at Texas A&M University. 
This was a group project where we developed a a student dashboard application for a local school in College Station, TX.
The application provides the following functionalities:

  1. Custom Authentication and Login for students and admin
  2. Ability for students to provide feedback and submit requests to principal admin
  3. Ability for an admin to add, delete and update student information into a database.
  
The technology stack used was NodeJS with Express on the server side with EJS templating framework to display dynamic content to the user.
We used MYSQL as our database. The application was hosted on Heroku and initial credentials shared with the client.
